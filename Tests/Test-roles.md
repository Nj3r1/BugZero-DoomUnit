QA Specialist-Teresiah Waweru

Focus Area: Manual Testing, Exploratory Testing, and UI/UX Validation

.Structured Test Execution: Develop and execute detailed manual test cases specifically for the User Management Module (encompassing user registration, authentication, profile management, and role-based access controls). Systematically perform tests on the Waste Pickup Scheduling functionality, verifying request initiation, status transitions, and search/filtering capabilities.

.Exploratory Defect Identification: Proactively engage in exploratory testing to identify potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behaviors, with a particular emphasis on critical areas such as role-based access control violations and comprehensive form input validations.

.Comprehensive Defect Documentation: Ensure all discovered defects are thoroughly documented, including precise steps to reproduce, relevant screenshots, and supplementary video evidence.

.Cross-Platform UI/UX Verification: Validate the application's responsiveness and visual integrity across a range of browsers (Chrome, Edge) and device types (Android mobile, desktop). Confirm the correct functioning of navigation elements, input fields, error messaging, and system notifications.

.Test Data Lifecycle Management: Prepare, organize, and maintain all necessary test data sets required for the execution of manual test cases .
